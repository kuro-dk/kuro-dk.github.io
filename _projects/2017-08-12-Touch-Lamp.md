This is an early stage mock-up of a desk lamp from a project I have worked on. I got rather free hands with this, in regard to what features to include, only real constraints were that it should be round and about the same size as a Galia Melon and battery powered. For many years I have been a user of the small app called [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) that changes the colour temperature of the light coming from your computer screen, depending on the time of day, to make it easier for you to get a good night's sleep, even when working late on the computer. Since the lamp was meant to be placed at a bedside table, I thought that it just needed to have a feature similar to f.lux. I managed to source a LED strip with LEDs of different colour temperatures on, so I would be able to fade between them, and thereby create a nice sliding transition. To be able to register when someone picked it up, or just touched it, I added some sensors and a couple of strips of copper tape, that was used for capacitive touch and remote sensing. That means that the lamp is able to sense a hand that is going to touch it, before it touches it. To be able to play around with more possible scenarios, I also added an internal bluetooth speaker as well as a vibrator.
All of this to be able to try out different experiences, and possible interactions with the lamp. Unfortunately the project was cancelled before any of these features could be explored.
