I found an old NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) Â controller, that for some odd reason had been mutilated and got its connector cut off. Would be sad to just throw it out, and I didn't own a NES, so I decided to make it into a gamepad that would function on my computer. I took it apart, and fitted an Arduino Pro Micro inside of it. The Pro Micro is able to act as a Human Interface Device, so the computer would see it as a keyboard, a mouse or in this case a game controller.

Finding the pinout of the shift register inside the controller was rather easy, and someone else had already gotten the Pro Micro to act as a Game controller.

It ended up working quite well, and I found a suitable black USB cable, to make it look like that it had always been like this.
