I and a friend had gotten hold of a old payphone. We decided to modify it to work as the in-house phone at the local Hackerspace. But since we had to remove almost all the old electronics, the display was not showing anything anymore, and we can't have that :3
So I managed to find the documentation for the [display controller](https://www.datasheets360.com/pdf/3994523105133384621), and wrote some Arduino code that made it display random words. Of course I included some of the rude words that every kid in 7th grade with a calculator have written ^_^
If you can't remember what those were or are just curious to see it, your are welcome to come by [Labitat](http://www.labitat.dk/).
