I have wanted to make my own custom PCB for quite a while, and with the current prices of PCBs in 2017, there was no real excuse. But finding a simple project to start out with can be a bit tricky. I have been really impressed by some of the artistic PCB designs that people have made using [PCBmodE](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode), an open source PCB editing tool. But the software is far from user friendly. So I opted for another open source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software called [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). The learning curve of KiCad is a lot less intimidating, and in recent years it has become one of the most popular EDA tools among hobbyist, and even some professionals.
But yeah, I still had to design something. And I wanted to get it back from China before Christmas. I ended up designing a gift tag to put on the Christmas gifts.
Most EDA software is not really focused on making nice and curvy designs. I was lucky to find a nice [article](https://medium.com/@urish/a-practical-guide-to-designing-pcb-art-b5aa22926a5c), describing how to use some scripts together with KiCad, to convert vector files into something that could be imported into KiCad. It was a bit tricky and fiddly, but it ended up rather well, and I got the prints just in time for Christmas.

A crazy thing to add to this is, that I ended up paying nothing for the 10 PCBs I received. The supplier had a deal that if your design was Christmas themed, and within certain specs, you got it for free. So I am definitely going to do something similar again, next time I really want to add some electronics through :3
