Many departments sometimes want to visualize what everybody in the apartment are occupied with a bit more, so it is not just hidden away in an Outlook calendar somewhere on your already cluttered screen.
We needed something more colorful and something more playful. So when one of my colleagues stumbled upon someone who had used LEGO bricks to make a wall-mounted calendar, that showed what projects people were currently working on, I was asked to make something similar for my department.
After a couple of brainstorms and figuring out where to buy specific LEGO parts in large numbers, which was a lot harder than expected, I made a couple of virtual mock-ups using [LEGO Digital Designer](https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd).

When all had agreed on a design, I CNC-cut some simple wooden plates to mount it all on. I also found some appropriate extruded aluminium pieces, that made it possible to mount it all on the wall, in an elegant way.
The original idea was to have 10 boards in two rows, showing the next 5 weeks, but it ended up being reconfigured, so that every board was one week. The aluminium extrusions make it possible, to just slide the boards to the side when we get to the next week.
A way to make it seem a bit more personal, everybody in the department choose their own LEGO figure to represent them, and to put next to their name and their specific colored brick to be used in the calendar.
To contain all the small pieces that were going to be used to show what people are working on, I found some rather appropriate transparent containers. I had thought about making some nice wooden boxes, but it would be a bit sad to hide all the colorful LEGO bricks.
After sourcing all the parts, it was a rather simple task to mount it all.
The calendar has been used extensively, and people have enjoyed it a lot to be able to just take a glance at it to get an overview of who is doing what. It has also been a good conversation starter with people from other departments, and yeah it's just a fun thing to have on the wall.
