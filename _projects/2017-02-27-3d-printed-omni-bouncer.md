I had just bought a used Nikon SB-24 flash online for a bargain price, but it didn't come with an omni bouncer. An omni bouncer is Â a simple flash accessory that diffuses the light, and spreads it more evenly in a room.
I found the retail prices in Denmark to be way too expensive, so I ended up designing my own in Google Sketchup, and printed it on one of the very first [RepRaps](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap) at the local hackerspace, for about a 1/40 of the retail price.
This is the first thing I ever 3D printed, a rather simple object, but it worked in the first try, and I have used it quite a few times.
