This project was triggered from being frustrated of my 3D printer not working properly. For some time I had wanted to organize my pens a bit better, and I had seen one of my friends 3D printing a simple [organizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1294085) from thingiverse.

At that time i still had some issues with my 3D printer, so I shelved the idea for a week or two. One day at a conference, I started doodling, and ended up sketching some ideas for a pen organizer that could be cut on a laser cutter. The reason to choose to Â cut it by laser, was that I had easy access to one, and even if the design process would take some time, it would be a lot faster to cut an organizer than to print one. And in addition, things that are laser cut, tend to look a lot more like a finished product than something that is 3D printed.
I wanted to keep the slimplicity of the model I saw on thingiverse, and try to see if I could hide as much of the structure as possible, so that the pens in it would be clearly visible.
I am rather happy with the final design. It is really quick to cut out, and simple to assemble. It could even fit without glue, but I just don't want to risk suddenly having pens and pencils all over my desk :)
